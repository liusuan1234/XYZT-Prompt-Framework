# XYZT-Prompt-Framework
The XYZT Prompt Framework proposed in this paper is the first universal prompt system based on four-dimensional structural thinking. It is compatible with multimodal tasks such as image, text, audio, video, and code generation, and enables phased generation and multi-stage optimization through the Timeline (T) dimension.
